Functions for working with microbial data in R

This repository contains the following scripts:
1. BDpartition.R    -- USE: partition variation in diversity to components of sample and species contribution.
2. true.diversity.R -- USE: calculate community diversity, based on Hill's numbers.
3. tax_glom_fast.R  -- USE: pool abundances at a desired taxonomic level. Much faster than tax_glom() in package phyloseq.
4. tax.bar.plot.R   -- USE: make a bar plot of sample-specific relative abundance, at a given taxonomic level.
5. OTU_barplot.R    -- USE: plots the relative abundance of a taxon as a barplot.
6. diversity.rarefaction.curves -- USE: perform community rarefaction and calculate desired estimates of Hill's diversite.
